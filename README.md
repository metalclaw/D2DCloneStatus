# D2DCloneStatus

Displays current status of Diablo Clone for all regions and game types.
Pulls data from d2clone API from https://diablo2.io

If you just want the executable you can download it from D2DCloneStatus/bin/Debug/ folder. You will need all those .dll libraries as well for it to work.

If you find bugs or have suggestions please open an issue on github repo.
Cheers!
